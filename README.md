# Week 1 Toy Problems

This repository contains solutions to three coding problems that were part of a weekend challenge at Moringa School. Below is the description and details of each problem.

For all the problems, I used the `prompt-sync` module to accept user input via prompts.

### **Installation Instructions**

To run the programs locally, you will need to install the `prompt-sync` module. If the program doesn't run on your machine, please execute the following command to install the necessary package:

```bash
npm install prompt-sync
```
## **1. Student Grade Generator (`student_grade_generator.js`)**

This program prompts the user to input student marks and outputs the corresponding grade based on the following criteria:

- A: > 79
- B: 60 to 79
- C: 49 to 59
- D: 40 to 49
- E: < 40

### **How to Use**:
1. Run the program.
2. Enter the student's marks when prompted.
3. The program will output the corresponding grade.

## **2. Speed Detector (`speed_detector.js`)**

This program takes the speed of a car as input and checks whether the driver is within the speed limits. Based on the input, the program gives the following outputs:

- If the speed is within the legal limit, it outputs `"Ok"`.
- If the speed exceeds the limit, it calculates and displays the number of demerit points the driver should receive. Points are awarded based on the speed exceeding the legal limit.
- If the driver has accumulated 12 or more demerit points, their license is suspended.

### **How to Use**:
1. Run the program.
2. Enter the speed of the car when prompted.
3. The program will output either `"Ok"`, the demerit points, or a message indicating that the license has been suspended.


## **3. Net Salary Calculator (`net_salary_calculator.js`)**

This program calculates an individual's **Net Salary** by accepting inputs for **basic salary** and **benefits**. It then computes various deductions, including **PAYE (Pay As You Earn)**, **NHIF** (National Hospital Insurance Fund), and **NSSF** (National Social Security Fund) contributions based on rates provided on the following link:

- [Payroll Tax Rates](https://www.aren.co.ke/payroll/taxrates.htm)

### **How to Use**:
1. Run the program.
2. Enter your basic salary and benefits when prompted.
3. The program will calculate and display the net salary after deducting taxes and other statutory contributions.

This program emulates the official PAYE calculator used by the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA). You can find more information about the KRAâ€™s tax rates and calculators at:
